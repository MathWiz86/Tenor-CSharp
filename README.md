# Tenor: A C# Extension Library

## About
Tenor is a public library for extending C# functionality. All code can be used in C# 8.0 projects and beyond. It adds useful functions that you may find yourself having to rebuild from scratch per project under normal circumstances.

## Development
Tenor is developed in Unity Engine for ease of use/testing, and for later use in another asset I will be making for Unity Engine specifically.

## How To Download
Tenor is currently in pre-alpha, and thus has no releases.
- ADD TO UNITY
	- Copy the '.git' cloning link for the repository.
	- Open Unity's Package Manager, and click the '+' icon at the top left of the window.
	- Select 'Add package from git URL'.
	- Paste in the copied link from earlier. Unity will handle creating the folder in your 'Packages'.
- ADD TO C# PROJECT
	- You only need to download the 'Runtime' folder.
	- In this folder, delete the '.asmdef' file. This is only needed in Unity.
